<u1>
				<h3 class="text-capitalize"><b>LITIGATION</h3></b>
				<p>India has a well defined substantive and procedural laws along with a well-established system of judicial enforcement of rights. India has a three tier system of judiciary, which includes District Courts, at the first tier. At the second tier, each state in India has a High Court which has the appellate and supervisory jurisdiction over all the district courts and tribunals in such state. The Supreme Court of India which is at the third tier, is the highest court of justice in India having appellate and supervisory jurisdiction over all High Courts in the country and it is the highest authority for all tribunals and all other authorities. </p>
				<p>Litigation is of two types, Civil and Criminal and there is subdivision in these two types.
				<p><b>Civil Cases </b>- Civil cases mostly involves disputes between persons or organizations.A civil case begins when a person or entity claims that another person or entity has failed to carry out a legal duty owed. In these cases generally court tell the parties to fulfill the duty, or make compensation for the harm done, or both.

                <p><b>Criminal Cases </b>-Criminal cases involve an action that is considered to be harmful for the entire society. The criminal procedure applies to the process where the state or government is arresting and trying someone for a crime that was committed.in these cases punishment is given to the wrongdoers, or fine may be imposed.

				<h3 class="text-capitalize"><b>WHAT IS ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR)?</h3></b>
				<p>ADR is the procedure for settling disputes without litigation, such as arbitration, mediation, or negotiation. ADR procedures are usually less costly and speedier.</p>
				<h3 class="text-capitalize"><b>ADR COMPRISES OF:</h3></b>
				<p><b>ARBITRATION </b>– This process can be only started if there is a valid arbitration agreement between the parties. Any party to the dispute can start the process of appointing arbitrator and if the other party does not cooperate, the party can approach the office of Chief Justice for appointment of an arbitrator.</p>
				<p><b>CONCILIATION</b> - Conciliation is a less formal form of arbitration. This process does not require an existence of any prior agreement. Any party can request the other party to appoint a conciliator.</p>
				<p><b>MEDIATION</b> – It is a form of ADR which aims to assist two (or more) disputants in reaching an agreement.The parties themselves determine the conditions of any settlements reached— rather than accepting something imposed by a third party.</p>
