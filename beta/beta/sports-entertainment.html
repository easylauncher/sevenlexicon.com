				<h3 class="text-capitalize"><b>BACKGROUND</h3></b>
				<p><b>Sports Laws</p></b>
				Sports law is one of those fields of law which are considered as applied law. It is a practical law and is concerned with how law in interacts with the activity known as sports, physical education etc.
                There are no specific laws related to sport in India but the same is covered under the various branches of laws which are applicable in India which are laws related to Contract, Media, Administrative, Public Competition, Drafting and Negotiation, tort, taxation, labour, TV rights, trademark, match fixing and related criminal laws etc.</p>

				<p><b>Gaming Laws</p></b>
				In India online gaming is not prohibited, online gaming is allowed in most of the states in India but some of the states has prohibited online gambling (example – teen patti, rummy, poker etc.)
                Even though gambling is not illegal, a distinction between skill-based games and games based on pure chance is made. State Governments and their legislators have made poker, rummy, e-sports, and fantasy sports legal. Some of the reasons why these games are legal are because they are based on a player's skills, and they are also easily taxed.</p>
                <p>Various courts in India have examined the difference between the game of skill and game of chance and in order to determine what constitutes gaming as defined in various state enactments (i.e. gambling); it is imperative to understand the difference between a "game of skill" and a "game of chance". The states of Sikkim and Nagaland are the only states to have adopted specific legislation that permits and regulates online gambling, namely the: Sikkim Online Gaming (Regulation) Act 2008 (“Sikkim Gambling Law”) was passed on June 28, 2008, with the dual objects of controlling and regulating online gaming through electronic or non-electronic formats, and imposing a tax on such games in the State of Sikkim. </p>
